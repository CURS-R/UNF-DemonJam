On May 28th 2022, [JazzyLucas](https://github.com/JazzyLucas) and [Enkidu202](https://github.com/Enkidu202) submitted a "Unlock the Safe in the Dark" as participants from the University of North Florida's Game Design Club for the Demon Jam on itch.io. Their project was awarded **1st place overall**.

This GitHub repository is the source-code for the submission along with a commit history to display the progress.

The project (made in 1 week) featured:
- 3D Procedural dungeon-style generated map with unique playthroughs.
- Baked NavMesh at runtime (with the procedural generation) to allow enemy AI pathfinding. 
- Random reverb cartoon sound effects for horrifying game-feel.
- Random flickering lights that cause player to be seen by the enemy.
- Animated and scary Among Us style enemy.
- Confetti if you win! :)

Check out some early film of the fast procedural gen dungeon with runtime baked navmesh!
